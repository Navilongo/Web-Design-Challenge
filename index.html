                    As part of the json and api practice, we have been tasked with demonstrating our 
                    ability to pull information from the online databases and compile it to show meaningful information. 
                    In this instance, we are tasked to prove important geography facts like, does it really get hotter the closer you are to the equator,
                     and is there greater wind currents the further away you are from the equator?
                </p>
                <p> To better visualize the information compiled from over 500 different random cities, we used Matplotlib to 
                    create graphs which can be easier analyzed than the written data. On these pages, you will find graphs that visualize the impact of: 
                    Lattitude vs. Humidity, Temperature, Cloudiness and the Wind.
