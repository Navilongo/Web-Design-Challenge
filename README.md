# Web Design - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

We have been working in multiple languages since the start of 2021, learning how to code, query information and create simple applications. Now it is time to show case some of the hard work we've done.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this project we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.

These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
     
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
